This is a basic python file to use the speedtest API (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/speedtest-cli/) and log the results to a CSV file. The results are time, ping, download, upload , and server. This is intented to be ran as a CRON job. 

The filesplit.py is to split the timestamp into date / time for better filtering. Next version to have this function intergrated
into the main file.
